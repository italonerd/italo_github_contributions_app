This is a Play Framework project to get contributions by contributor name for every repository of an organization using GitHub API for Java(https://github-api.kohsuke.org/).

Hello everyone, for a mocked example you can use this url(in local env):<br>
    http://localhost:9000/api/v1/organizations/mock/contributors<br>

For a specific organization you can use a specific organization login instead of "mock".<br>
To get some organization you can go to <a href="https://api.github.com/organizations ">https://api.github.com/organizations</a>.

Response for url "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/organizations/entryway/contributors":<br>
```

    },
    {

    }
]
```

ps. I've limited the number of repositories iterated due to GitHub API Request Limits (https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps).
